# Logistic-regression
logistic regression attempt

This is my first try using a logistic regression algorithm. It uses a heart diseases dataset for predicting the probability of future heart diseases. I tried it using Linear regression and then later on realised that it has a categorical target variables, so i switched over to logistic regression algorithm. Still I'm getting very low accuracy for the model and I do not know why that is. Hope I could improve it in the future!
